## Place the motors on the frame (this one is made of a thick cardboard) and make holes to pass the cables to the upper section.

## Lastly connect the Raspberry pi with the bridge as shown, using the 4 "IN" pins to control the wheels and make sure you have an external power supply that gives enough voltage for the pi.
